        <p style="color: cornsilk;">Guido Van Rossum published the first version of Python code (version 0.9.0) at alt.sources in February 1991.
            This release included already exception handling, functions, and the core data types of list, dict, str and
            others. It was also object oriented and had a module system.

            Python version 1.0 was released in January 1994. The major new features included in this release were the
            functional programming tools lambda, map, filter and reduce, which Guido Van Rossum never liked.

            Six and a half years later in October 2000, Python 2.0 was introduced. This release included list
            comprehensions, a full garbage collector and it was supporting unicode.

            Python flourished for another 8 years in the versions 2.x before the next major release as Python 3.0 (also
            known as "Python 3000" and "Py3K") was released. Python 3 is not backwards compatible with Python 2.x. The
            emphasis in Python 3 had been on the removal of duplicate programming constructs and modules, thus
            fulfilling or coming close to fulfilling the 13th law of the Zen of Python: "There should be one -- and
            preferably only one -- obvious way to do it."</p>
